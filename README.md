<h2>Prerequisites to learn PHP</h2>
Learning a new programming language can be a bit overwhelming. Many people don’t know where to start and give up before they begin. Learning PHP is not as overwhelming as it might seem. One of the reasons for PHP’s success is that it has really great documentation. One can just dive into the documentation and get started without having any particular set of skills.
But once you have gained some knowledge in PHP, you will need to learn other languages for using PHP effectively. The languages include:
-HTML
-MySQL
-CSS
-JavaScript
<h2>Why do we need PHP?</h2>W
You must be wondering that why do we need PHP for web programming when we already have other scripting languages like HTML.
So let’s move ahead with the PHP Tutorial and find out some of the compelling reasons for using PHP:
It is open-source and free scripting language
It has short learning curve compared to other languages such as JSP, ASP etc.
Most web hosting servers support PHP by default
It is a server-side scripting language so you need to install it on the server and client computers requesting for resources from the server do not need to have PHP installed
PHP has in built support for working hand in hand with MySQL
It is cross platform so you can deploy your application on a number of different operating systems such as windows, Linux, Mac OS etc.
